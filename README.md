PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING CHEST X RAY IMAGES


This project aims to diagnose whether someone has been infected with pneumonia based on
the chest X-ray of the person. And we also want to classify whether the pneumonia is caused
by bacteria or viruses based on the image.  

The objective of our project is to analyze the patientâ€™s chest X-ray and identify whether 
the patient has pneumonia or not and classify the type of the pneumonia based on the image 
using CNN and other deep learning method. 

Run the code per cell from the first to the last cell.
